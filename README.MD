# High School Final Project - Dual System PHP Mockup

Final high school project for web development. This is a **mockup PHP site** that I built as a proof-of-concept for a dual system—one backend for employees (with a management system) and a frontend for customers that showcases employees and the solutions they offer. I just learned PHP, so this site is a bit rough around the edges, but I'm really proud of what I've done!

## What's Inside

- **Dual Backend & Frontend**  
  The site has two main sections:  
  - **Employee Backend:** A basic system where employees can log in, manage their details, and update info.  
  - **Customer Frontend:** A customer-facing part that displays employee profiles and solution info.
  
- **Jokey Chatlogs**  
  One of my favorite parts of the project is the chat log feature. It's totally silly and fun—the chatlogs are auto-updating (yes, they refresh on their own!) and offer a quirky way for employees to interact and leave funny comments.

- **Proof of Concept**  
  I want to emphasize that while the site is kind of a crappy version of what a professional project might look like, it's a pretty neat proof-of-concept. I learned a lot about PHP, HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript along the way :D

## How It Works

1. **Employee System:**  
   Log in to the employee backend with the provided credentials. Once logged in, you can manage your profile, post updates, and view the chat logs.
   
2. **Customer Interface:**  
   Customers can browse the list of employees and check out the solutions offered. The design is simple but clean—I'm especially proud of how it looks!

3. **Autoupdating Chatlogs:**  
   The chatlog feature uses a basic auto-refresh technique to simulate real-time updates. It might not be the most sophisticated method out there, but it does the trick for this project.

## Live demo
If you wanna have some fun and poke around, it's currently up on my server at http://207.127.89.39 but it's kinda barebones.
